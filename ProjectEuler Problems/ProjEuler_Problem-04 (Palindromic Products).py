#Method 3 - Cheese method
#Explanation (this is an odd one): our palindrome is a product of 2 3 digit numbers, which means it's at least 6 digits long (a spit out result from method1, not proved here)
#since that's the case, we can write it as Pal = 100001x + 010010y + 001100z with x,y,&z being our palindromed digits
#we can pull out the prime factor 11 from that & use the fact that 11's got to be a prime factor of either A or B, allowing us to speed through
#I feel like there's a breakage case here if we started going above 999; but I'm not positive, and don't have time atm to verify.
