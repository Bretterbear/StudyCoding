Mini projects / Code Chunks 
archive of some of my work; the bulk has been lost due to a failed seagate drive. Lesson learned: never assume data loss can't happen to you!

Contents:
"Cracking the Coding Interview Problems" - C++ solutions for problems in "Cracking The Coding Interview"; WIP
"ProjectEuler Problems" - Python solutions for problems posed by the website "Project Euler"; WIP
"SchoolProject - Java Hangman Game" - a surviving school project that's a basic visual java hangman game
"MathProject - LATEX textbook portfolio" - an old school project to write a summary of coursework for math degree in LATEX; added here as a redundant backup because I was actually quite proud of this.
